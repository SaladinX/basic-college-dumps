# FizzBuzz Challenge in C

The FizzBuzz challenge is a simple programming exercise often used as a screening test for job candidates. The task is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".The FizzBuzz challenge is a simple programming exercise often used as a screening test for job candidates.
