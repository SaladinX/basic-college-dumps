FizzBuzz Challenge in C
The FizzBuzz challenge is a simple programming exercise often used as a screening test for job candidates. The task is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

Copy code
gcc fizzbuzz.c -o fizzbuzz
Run the compiled program

Copy code
./fizzbuzz
Expected Output
The program should print the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three it should print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five it should print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five it should print "FizzBuzz".
