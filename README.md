# Basic-college-dumps
"The 'College C Coding Dumpster' may seem like a simple repository for code, but it holds within it a deeper meaning. It represents the ever-evolving nature of knowledge, the constant cycle of learning and enlightenment. The dumpster serves as a reminder that no code is ever truly discarded, as it can always be repurposed and used to further one's understanding. It also serves as a symbol of effort  required to push the boundaries of what is possible with C coding, while surviving the greatest sorrows and sins @ EMSI-Rabat University. It serves as a reminder of where you started and how far you've come, so dive in and discover the true value of the code and the community within this dumpster."
